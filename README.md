I wanted to create an app to create wordclouds by scraping text from webpages. I'm an avid surfer and wanted to see which words were emphasized in two Wikipedia pages:
* [Surfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing)
* [Surfline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfline)

## Text Extraction
Two methods were used to extract the text using python code. It's important to clean the scrapped text to remove stopwords and symbols. 
* First method uses the Python library [wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/). This is an easy to use built in library for downloading and parsing data, including text.
* Second method is using the Python library [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) in combination with [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html). BeautifulSoup is a powerful library and can customize webscraping scraping of websites in general (not just Wikipedia). Urllib is a package that allows you to open and read URLs.

Webpage HTML is messy and need to delete or replace symbols as needed with the library re or regular expresion. Moreover, we needed to delete the stopwords like 'the' and 'a' using the package named 'STOPWORDS' in the [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) library.

## Create Plot Function
We use matplotlib to create a plot. Create a function that creates the image of the wordcloud, its dimensions, and saves the image. 

## The Wordclouds
Now we generate the wordcloud and define the attributes like the size and colors. 

I'm an avid surfer and I use Surfline every day to check the surf forecast. Therefore, I wanted to see what kinds of words were written about 'surfing' and 'Surfline.'

And there you go! It's no surprise that some of the words are similar while others are more specific to predictions. What's interest is that California is emphasied in Surfline. But is it surprising? Not really. California has some of the best surf in the world and the company is based there. 

I hope you had fun learning about how to make your own wordclouds by scraping the web.
